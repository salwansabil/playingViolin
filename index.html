            Learning to play the violin at first may seem very tedious and complex, however,
            making an <em>effort</em> to begin is the hardest step! A lot of people become discouraged
            since they see younger children that are prodigies playing at an advanced level, but all it takes
            is dedication and discipline while practicing to enhance on your skills as a violinist.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Music Lessons</h2>
        
        <p>
            The only way to get better at playing the violin is experience! Without actually playing
            the instrument, you will not get better. Simply watching an experienced musician is not enough.
            Music lessons with an instructor one-on-one or with a small orchestra is the best way to learn 
            and grow. Although there is no age limit to play any instrument, playing at an earlier age definitely
            will promote faster learning. This also translates outside the violin lessons and over to their 
            academic careers as well. I recommend the <a href="https://www.lbmusicschool.com/violin-lessons" target="_blank">LB Music School</a>, 
            where they have professional teachers that nurture and further develop students' violin skills, 
            even if they are complete beginners.

        <h2>How to get a Violin</h2>
        
        <p>
            The first thing to do when interested in playing the violin is to get your hands on one! When going about
            finding a violin, you have two options; purchasing your own, or renting one. This is important because violins 
            are very expensive due to several different options, such as the wood type used to produce the intrument or the string types.
            If you have a younger child that is not sure if they want to even pursue playing this instrument, it is recommended to rent for around nine
            months to see if they are interested. However, if you are certain on buying one, it will be a worthwhile investment since you do not need to 
            keep returning the violin and renting another one. A reliable business that sells violins and is trusted by teachers across the nation is <a href="https://www.johnsonstring.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=432954443&gbraid=0AAAAAD_lLINIPHvAFlOzRXek_jeiFrEPf&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxdXBBhDEARIsAAUkP6gU7laTbQudcj2ulWWFs7r0I_AdLuQKmR2twYUiK8LmE6BtSTmG89caAjveEALw_wcB" target="_blank">Johnson String Instrument</a>.
            They offer great deals for students and works with local schools to ensure any student that wants to learn will be able to acquire a violin and other musical needs.

        <h3>Comparing Different Levels of Violins</h3>
        
        <p>
            Since the range of prices for violins are around a couple hundred dollars to over $50,000, it can be difficult to choose one that is right for you
            and still fits in your budget. For students it is recommended to use a violin under $3,000. Below is a table with a sample of violins that can help understand different
            types of ideal student violins that still will be affordable.

        <h2>Experience Orchestras and Symphonies</h2>
        
        <p>
            Attending orchestras and symphonies is a great way to see musicians that have mastered their intruments in action.
            Watching these in person gives great motivation and displays the music created by genius composers from the past such as Mozart, Vivaldi, Chopin, etc.
